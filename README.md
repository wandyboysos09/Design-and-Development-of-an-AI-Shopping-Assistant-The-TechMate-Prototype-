# Design-and-Development-of-an-AI-Shopping-Assistant-The-TechMate-Prototype-
1. Project Overview

This project is a prototype of an intelligent web chatbot designed to assist customers of a computer and accessories store. It is built as a full-stack web application, with a Python backend handling the AI logic and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend providing the user interface. The chatbot is capable of answering a variety of customer questions related to product information, store hours, and technical support.

2. Key Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot understands and responds to user queries using a trained neural network model.

Intent-Based Responses: It can classify user requests into predefined intents (e.g., greetings, tech_support, shop_products) and provide relevant, human-like responses.

Intuitive Web Interface: The chatbot operates as a modern, real-time web chat widget, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Robust Backend: The backend, built with Flask, acts as a bridge between the front end and the AI model, ensuring seamless communication.

4. Setup and Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using a Git client or by downloading the ZIP file.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project's root folder in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy nltk flask

Step 3: Train the AI Model
The chatbot requires a pre-trained model to function. Run the training script to generate the necessary files (chatbot_model.keras, words.pkl, classes.pkl).

python COM727/Intelligent AI Web Chatbot/preparation/model_training.py

Step 4: Run the Web Server
Once the model is trained, start the Flask web server to launch the chatbot.

python COM727/Intelligent AI Web Chatbot/app.py

Step 5: Access the Chatbot
Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address, typically: http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

4. Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders and files to ensure modularity:

COM727/

Intelligent AI Web Chatbot/

app.py: The Flask web server. It serves the HTML front end and handles API requests for chatbot messages.

chatbot.py: The core AI logic. It loads the trained model and processes user inputs to get a response.

model_training.py: The training script. It processes the intents and trains the neural network.

intents.json: The knowledge base of the chatbot, containing all conversational patterns and responses.

preparation/

model/: This folder contains the files generated by model_training.py, including the trained model and processed data.

chatbot_model.keras

words.pkl

classes.pkl

5. Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Flask (Web Framework)

TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)

NLTK (Natural Language Processing)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)

6. Future Work
Link to a live product database: Connect to a database with inventory of its count of products to swap out products and their count when user(s) needs change.

Advanced Natural Language Processing: Explore more complex models such as Transformers to enhance the flow and accuracy of conversation.

Multiple Languages: Improve the bot to work with different languages.

UI/UX Improvements: Add new features like typing indicators, and voice input.
